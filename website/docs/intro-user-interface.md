## App Manager
Navigate to the first icon in the leftmost menu to open the app manager. This is where you can see all the apps that are currently installed on your machine. 

An app is a collection of tasks. In the following screenshot, the *MacOS-Display* app is selected, and we can see several tasks in this app on the right half.

### Configure and start tasks
For any tasks in a selected app, you can configure how the task would be executed. If you hover the mouse over a task, you will see four icons appear on the right side of the task name. You can click these icons to configure the task. These icons are:

- <u>Android</u>: whether to autostart the task
- <u>Clock</u>: schedule the task to run later
- <u>Keyboard</u>: set up a hotkey for the task
- <u>Cloud</u>: run the task on a cloud server

Once you finish configuring the task, you can click the task name to start the task.

### Task bar
For frequently used tasks, you can also check the checkbox next to the task name, and collapse the window by clicking the AuTool rabbit logo. All these selected tasks will be shown in the collapsed task bar, and you can click on the task name to start it from task bar.

You can download apps from github links (e.g., https://github.com/danalites/apps/MacOS-Display), or you can create blank app and fill it with custom tasks later.


## Task Scheduler

Click the second icon in the leftmost menu to open the task scheduler. This is where you can see all the active task instances, including tasks that are:

- Currently running
- Scheduled to run later
- Waiting to be executed by hotkey
- Stopped normally or by error
